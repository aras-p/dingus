CODE

+ Scroller scene
. Fade out physics pieces
. Don't shadow ceiling
. Restore walls (put back pieces, blend in wall, maybe blur)
. Attack effects
. Tweak first attack's positions (lower)
. Time-blend character's texture
. Shadows for other guys (needed?)
. DoF
. Glow; render extra brightness to alpha
. Fresnel for reflections?
. Loading screen
. Blur in/out in several places
. Reflections into single RT, with stencil/Z masks for fast culling
. Cull walls for reflections
. Look at asm of the shaders, profile
. Aniso filter for some objects?
. 2nd room (waiting for layout)

+ Tweak last attack position (clear walls for doors)
+ Optimize/hack physics for the massive fracture scene
+ Shadows from bed/wallpieces

* Fade out bed/stone pieces
* Floor/ceil doesn't fracture, replace by fixed meshes
* Reflect outer room
* Frustum cull objects
* Animate doors
* Other characters
* Single smooth group for physics pieces' caps
* Don't render wall caps for reflections
* Fix lighting on some objects bug
* Light pos in object space via fx params



ART

. Low poly / UV / NMap 2nd gargoyle
. (Antanas?) Animate camera target or dummy object for DoF focus distance
. (Antanas) Hand-make fractured floor/ceil meshes and 2nd room

+ nvdxt all textures, experiment with mip filters
* NMap top/ceil/floor bricks
