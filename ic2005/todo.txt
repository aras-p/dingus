CODE

+ Restore walls (put back pieces, blend in wall, maybe blur)
+ Scroller scene
. Tweak character lighting
. Attack effects
. Shadows for other guys (needed?)
. DoF
. Glow; render extra brightness to alpha
. Fresnel for reflections?
. Loading screen
. Blur in/out in several places
. Reflections into single RT, with stencil/Z masks for fast culling
. Cull walls for reflections
. Look at asm of the shaders, profile
. Aniso filter for some objects?
. 2nd room (waiting for layout)
. Interactive mode
. Interactive mode tweak UI

+ Time-blend character's texture
+ Tweak last attack position (clear walls for doors)
+ Optimize/hack physics for the massive fracture scene
+ Shadows from bed/wallpieces

* Tweak first attack's positions (lower)
* Fade out physics/bed/stone pieces
* Don't shadow ceiling
* Floor/ceil doesn't fracture, replace by fixed meshes
* Reflect outer room
* Frustum cull objects
* Animate doors
* Other characters
* Single smooth group for physics pieces' caps
* Don't render wall caps for reflections
* Fix lighting on some objects bug
* Light pos in object space via fx params



ART

. (Paulius?) Adjust room layout to fill 1-px gaps somewhere.
. (Antanas?) Animate camera target or dummy object for DoF focus distance

+ nvdxt all textures, experiment with mip filters
+ (Antanas) Hand-make fractured floor/ceil meshes and 2nd room

* Low poly / UV / NMap 2nd gargoyle
* NMap top/ceil/floor bricks
