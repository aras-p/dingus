IN PROGRESS

CODE

. Benchmark mode!
. Shadows for other guys (needed?)
. Look at asm of the shaders, profile
. Aniso filter for some objects?
- Fresnel for reflections?
- Reflections into single RT, with stencil/Z masks for fast culling
- Tweak character lighting
- Glow; render extra brightness to alpha

+ Demo tweak UI

ART

. Lightmap seam in 2nd room
- Adjust room layout to fill 1-px gaps somewhere.
