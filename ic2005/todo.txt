CODE

+ Scroller scene
. Restore walls (put back pieces, blend in wall, maybe blur)
. Optimize/hack physics for the massive fracture scene
. Animate doors
. Cull walls for reflections
. Frustum cull objects (not priority)
. Reflections into single RT, with stencil/Z masks for fast culling
. DoF
. Glow; render extra brightness to alpha
. Fresnel for reflections?
. Loading screen
. Aniso filter for some objects?
. 2nd room (waiting for layout)

+ Single smooth group for physics pieces' caps
* Don't render wall caps for reflections
* Fix lighting on some objects bug
* Light pos in object space via fx params



ART

+ NMap top/ceil/floor bricks
. Low poly / UV / NMap 2nd gargoyle
. (Antanas?) Animate camera target or dummy object for DoF focus distance
+ nvdxt all textures, experiment with mip filters
