CODE

. Sink/fade physics pieces
+ Scene poetry at the end
+ Blur in/out in several places
+ Attack effects
. Take time source from music?
. Tweak character lighting
. Shadows for other guys (needed?)
. Glow; render extra brightness to alpha
. Fresnel for reflections?
. Loading screen
. Reflections into single RT, with stencil/Z masks for fast culling
. Look at asm of the shaders, profile
. Aniso filter for some objects?
. Interactive mode tweak UI

+ Interactive mode (waiting for attack fx meshes/anims)

* Fracture out whole ceiling, drop pieces
* Fix physics glitches (pieces standing on thin sides, stuck to walls etc.)
* Play/fadein/fadeout interactive mode music for scroller/intmode.
* Time-blend character's texture
* Separate light for 2nd room
* 2nd fractured room
* Scroller scene
* DoF
* Add 2nd room
* Optimize/hack physics for the massive fracture scene
* Tweak last attack position (clear walls for doors)
* Add music (added via BASS)
* Cull walls for reflections
* Shadows from bed/wallpieces
* Tweaks to wall restoring: perpixel light
* Reflect bed
* Restore walls (put back pieces, blend in wall)
* Tweak first attack's positions (lower)
* Fade out bed/stone pieces
* Don't shadow ceiling
* Floor/ceil doesn't fracture, replace by fixed meshes
* Reflect outer room
* Frustum cull objects
* Animate doors
* Other characters
* Single smooth group for physics pieces' caps
* Don't render wall caps for reflections
* Fix lighting on some objects bug
* Light pos in object space via fx params



ART

. (Paulius?) Adjust room layout to fill 1-px gaps somewhere.

+ nvdxt all textures, experiment with mip filters

* Low poly / UV / NMap 2nd gargoyle
* NMap top/ceil/floor bricks
