CODE

+ Shadows from bed/stone/wallpieces
+ Floor/ceil doesn't fracture, replace by fixed meshes
+ Scroller scene
. Restore walls (put back pieces, blend in wall, maybe blur)
. Fade out physics/bed/stone pieces
. Attack effects
. Tweak first attack's positions (lower)
. Time-blend character's texture
. Shadows for other guys (needed?)
. DoF
. Glow; render extra brightness to alpha
. Fresnel for reflections?
. Loading screen
. Blur in/out in several places
. Reflections into single RT, with stencil/Z masks for fast culling
. Cull walls for reflections
. Frustum cull objects (not priority)
. Look at asm of the shaders, profile
. Aniso filter for some objects?
. 2nd room (waiting for layout)

+ Tweak last attack position (clear walls for doors)
+ Optimize/hack physics for the massive fracture scene

* Animate doors
* Other characters
* Single smooth group for physics pieces' caps
* Don't render wall caps for reflections
* Fix lighting on some objects bug
* Light pos in object space via fx params



ART

+ NMap top/ceil/floor bricks
. Low poly / UV / NMap 2nd gargoyle
. (Antanas) Hand-make fractured floor/ceil meshes and 2nd room
. (Antanas?) Animate camera target or dummy object for DoF focus distance
+ nvdxt all textures, experiment with mip filters
