3dsMax's IGame library should be here (I'm not sure if I have rights to
include it along with my sourcecode).

I used version 1.122.

Layout is as follows: this directory contains:

3dsmax5/
  include/
    *.h
  IGame.dll
  IGame.lib
3dsmax6/
  include/
    *.h
  IGame.dll
  IGame.lib
IGameProp.xml
