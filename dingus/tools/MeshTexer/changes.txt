MeshTexer changelog

050629: Removed gloss generation. Preview light now is in view space
		(i.e. attached to camera).

050604: MeshTexer added to repository. This tool was used for in.out.side
		demo to generate textures on arbitrary models from tileable textures
		by projecting them. The initial release could generate diffuse and
		gloss map into one texture, but that was never used; so I'll throw
		the gloss part out really soon.
