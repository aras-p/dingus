
Dingus small rare developments
========
060618: fixed bug in CubeTextureBundle (caught by Brian Smith)
060225: quaternion slerp replaced by nlerp everywhere!
060219: renderFrustum, renderAABB added to DebugRenderer.
060216: Fix some mouse capture issues in GUI code.
060212: Migrated to VS.NET2003 (finally!), VC6 support may break at any
		time. Major cleanup of warnings. Removed old unused code
		(collision, physics, visibility).
		

Dingus tag 051101
========

051031: Texture/CubeTexture bundles can load .hdr images.
		CubeTexture bundle now supports loading cubemaps from vertical
		cross format.
051020: CRenderableQuad added, now drawing fullscreen postprocessing
		quads is much simpler. System now resets cached D3D stuff every
		frame; fixes some weird behavior with rendertargets (e.g. if the
		last rendertarget you render to is not backbuffer).
051017: CVertexFormat::calc[Normal/Tangent/Binorm]Offset added.
		CScreenBasedDivTextureCreator added - creates texture proportional
		to backbuffer (first BB size is made divisible by supplied amount).
		DINGUS_REGISTER_STEX_SURFACE helped macro added.
051015: CUIRollout::addChildControl()/offsetPos() added.
051011: CUIDialog::renderBegin()/renderEnd() added.
051001: Effects are checked for valid/missing state assignments (as
		required for the state restore system to work). For example,
		if you don't set SrcBlend when turning on alpha blending,
		the engine will complain.
050930: CStringHelper::countLines added.
050927: Big good change: if effects don't contain state restoring pass
		(PLast), it is automatically generated by the engine. In this
		case, you need to call setStatesConfig() on EffectBundle at
		init time, supplying script that contains knowledge of restored
		states; and use RESTORE_PASS macro in the effect file. More to
		be doc'd at dingus.berlios.de really soon now.
050925: gfx/gui/Gui.cpp fix to make it compile with VC7.1.
050917: Factored out sprite/text functions from GUI for more convenient
		immediate mode calling. getX()/getY() added to CUIDialog.
050628: Texture bundle always takes miplevels from file for DDS textures
		(previously it would build missing miplevels). Other formats
		build full mip chain like before.
050627: Poor unicode text support in GUI (drawText() only for now).
050612: utils/Pool.h fixes to make it compile with VC7.1. Fixed by
		Rich Thomson.


Dingus codenamed "IC2005 demo"
========

050523: Better error messages in texture and surface creator classes.
050518: comparison operators to time_value added.
		Gui always uses antialiased fonts now.
050517: setTime() helper to CTimer added.
050502: Animation stuff can take arbitrary time sources, not only system
		time. Also refactored to use time_values instead of floats
		for anim start times. time_value::fromsec() bugfix.
050424: Dynamic geometry buffers issue warning when reached full capacity.
		Character animator can start anims not only from current time.
050422: Removed old unused GUI stuff from gfx/gui.
		Removed hierarchy context/nodes. Unused crap :)
		3dsMax 5/6 mesh/animation exporters added to the repository.
050418: Dynamic index buffer manager added (CDynamicIBManager).
		CVBChunk is now TVBChunk (typedef for CBufferChunk<CD3DVertexBuffer>).
		gfx/geometry/VBChunk.h is no more, use gfx/geometry/BufferChunk.h now.
050416: Character animator now supports bone scaling.
050413:	rdtsc based timer added to utils (cputimer). Mostly for debugging.
050411:	Character animator now has history buffer for blending fast changing
		anims. Also can synch-blend walk cycles.
050411: Added ringdeque<T> to utils.
050410:	Removed unused anim abstraction layers (channels, context, listeners).
		Collapsed IAnimStream<T> and all derived classes into one concrete
		CAnimStream<T> class.
