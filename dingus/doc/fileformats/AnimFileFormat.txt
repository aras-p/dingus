DANIM file format:
Binary file, Intel byte order

Bytes	Desc
---- HEADER ----
4		Magic "DANI" chars
4		Sampling type: 0=sampled, others TBD.
4		Animation type: 0=clamp, 1=loop, 2=loop w/ last sample for transition
4		Animation curve count
4		Animation group count (each group contains same number of curves)

---- FOR EACH CURVE ----
asciiz	Curve name
4		Parent curve index (-1 if no parent)

[ the rest is for sampled animation case ]
4		Sample count in each of the curves (when not collapsed)

---- FOR EACH GROUP ----
4		Group data type, as enumerated in dingus::eAnimDataFileType
4		Data unit size (eg. 12 for float3)
asciiz	Group name
- for each curve in group -
4		Interpolator type, as enumerated in dingus::CAnimCurve::eIpol
4		First sample index
varies	Collapsed value - size of data unit
- end for each curve -
4		Total sample count in group (equal to non-collapsed-curves * samples-in-curve)
- for each sample -
varies	Sample value
- end for each sample -

EXPORTER details:

Exports groups in such order:
1) position - named "pos" (VEC3)
2) rotation - named "rot" (QUAT or QUAT_H)
3) scale - named "scale" (FLT or FLT_H) or "scale3" (VEC3 or VEC3_H)
4) camera (nearclip, farclip, fov) - named "cam", type VEC3
5) diffuse+opacity color - named "color", type COLOR
Each group is optional.
