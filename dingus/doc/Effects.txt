
Dingus renderer uses D3DX Effect files entensively and has some special
needs/features for them.


----
D3D STATE MANAGEMENT

Effects do not save/restore D3D device state in Dingus for efficiency
reasons. Instead, ALL effects (including the global one) MUST contain a last
pass called "PLast". In this pass, nothing is rendered, just the pass'
states are applied.

This way, effect's PLast pass can "restore" the state that is changed in
the previous passes.

What states actually need this restoring is up to the way your effects are
organized. For example, if ALL effects set VertexShader, there's no point in
restoring it. Likewise, if all effects that enable alpha blending set
SrcBlend and DestBlend, there's no point in restoring them to the previous
values.


----
GLOBAL EFFECT

There's a "global effect" that you supply when creating CRenderContext.
Nothing is rendered when this effect is applied, just the state in it's first
pass is set. Note that this effect MUST also contain a dummy "PLast" pass.

Global effect usually sets up some global state from CRenderContext global
parameters. This effect is applied manually by the user, by calling
applyGlobalEffect() on the render context.


----
ANNOTATIONS

Dingus can read some special annotations of the effects. An effect's
technique can contain these annotations that are understood by Dingus:


* bool backToFront
	If set to true, then this effect requires back-to-front sorting of
	the rendered objects.
* bool shadowMap
	If set to true, then this technique will only validate on the device
	that supports native shadow maps.
* bool floatTexture
	If set to true, then this technique will only validate on the device
	that supports floating point rendertargets.

An example of using annotations:
	technique tec0
	< bool backToFront = true; bool shadowMap = true; >
	{
		// ...
	}
